# This script demonstrates how to trap signals and handle them using functions

#### Variables
programName="$0" # used by error_functions.sh
sleepTime=1 # delay used by sleeptime
numberOfSleeps=30 # how many sleeps to wait for before quitting for inactivity

#### Functions
# This function will send an error message to stderr
# Usage:
#   error-message ["some text to print to stderr"]
#
function error-message {
        echo "${programName}: ${1:-Unknown Error - a moose bit my sister once...}" >&2
}

# This function will send a message to stderr and exit with a failure status
# Usage:
#   error-exit ["some text to print"]
#
function error-exit {
        error-message "$1"
        exit 1
}

function usage {
        cat <<EOF
Usage: ${programName} [-h|--help ] [-w|--waittime waittime] [-n|--waitcount waitcount]
Default waittime is 1, waitcount is 30
EOF
}

# Normally traps catch signals and do something useful or necessary with them

# Quit if we get SIGQUIT, but let the user know why we are exiting
function receivedQuit {
    echo "Received SIGQUIT"
    exit
}

# Squawk if we get SIGHUP
function receivedHup {
    echo "Received SIGHUP"
}

# If we get SIGINT, we reset the counter
function receivedInt {
    echo "Received SIGINT, resetting sleep count"
    sleepCount=$numberOfSleeps
}

# trap the signals we care about
trap receivedQuit SIGQUIT
trap receivedHup SIGHUP
trap receivedInt SIGINT
